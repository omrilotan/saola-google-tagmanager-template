## Structure

The project is structured to build a "tpl" file that can be imported into Google Tag Manager, but is maintained as separate files for easier development, and to allow local testing.

Do not edit the `tpl` file directly, as it is generated by the build process.

New test scemarios should be added to the `test` directory. The test runner will pick up any files in this directory and run them.

## [Versioning and template update](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/templates/gallery#submit_your_template)

The template "major" version is included in the "info" module.

After finishing editing a new version, add the change number (SHA number) to the versions section of your metadata.yaml file. Add new versions to the top of the list (reverse chronological order).

Commit the change to metadata.yaml and your update will appear in the gallery typically within 2 to 3 days.

```yaml
versions:
  - sha: 547c512f3687a9ab8c38b86d722d6820b4af6079
    changeNotes: Create SaolaAI GTM template
```

## Publishing

This repository is connected to the Google Tag Manager Template Gallery. After pushing changes, maintainers can publish the template from the Google Tag Manager interface.
